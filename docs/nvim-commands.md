# NeoVim Commands
Yes, that seems like a lot of commands, but trust me, it's all about muscle 
memory ;) Use it - and you will learn it - way faster as you think by now.

For me it was way easier to write the commands on Post-Its and place them on the
lower side of my screen, so I've seen them all the time.
If you like to see how I structure them, take a look [here](post-its.md).

I use one of these configurable split keyboards, but my layout is very near to 
the US ANSI layout.  
If you want to try it, there is a cheap (but very good) one from Cherry for
less than twenty bugs. The [Cherry KC 1000](https://www.cherry.de/kc-1000) in
US ANSI or EU(USA+ €-Symbol).

If something doesn't work, check if your caps lock is activated or not :)

## Neovim Modes
Neovim has different modes to get your actions done.  
The mode where you start is called `Normal Mode`.  
* **Normal Mode**
    * Used to navigate around, copy and paste (yank and put in Neovim language) things, etc.
* **Insert Mode**
    * Used to write like in every other text editor.
* **Visual Mode**
    * Used to mark text. It is divided by three different use cases:
        * Visual Mode (for marking characters)
        * Visual Line Mode (for marking whole lines)
        * Visual Block Mode (for marking blocks of characters)
* **Command Line Mode**
    * Write Neovim and terminal commands

Entry point for all modes is always `Normal Mode`.

<br>

## Wording
In Neovim copy is named 'yank' and paste is named 'put'.

<br>

## Explanation
If you see something like `<Leader>`, that's a special key in Neovim. Regularly 
it is the `\` key. In this configuration it is mapped to the `space` key.

In the column `Location` you will somethimes see `Regular Neovim`. This means, 
I didn't have created a special key mapping. Neovim provides this function by
default.  
For all other contents of this column, I provide the file where I've defined 
the key mapping. Feel free to change them if you like.

The most of the commands you can type numbers before, to run the command n times.
